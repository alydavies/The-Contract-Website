We're almost there, {{user.username}}!

Our Kickstarter is in its last 24 hours!

You can find it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sapientsnake/the-contract-rpg?ref=3lxlic

If you haven't pledged yet, it's your last chance to support us as we gather funds for our upcoming physical book!

If you have pledged, now's your last chance to share the kickstarter with your friends and family!

I'm asking everyone who ever enjoyed this game to please consider pledging just a few dollars to help us fill the book with incredible art. It's not too late to snag some rewards as well!

Again, you can find it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sapientsnake/the-contract-rpg?ref=3lxlic

Thank you for your support!

Sincerely,
Shady Tradesman
