Limits describe your Contractor's deepest boundaries. These are the actions and experiences that harm your Contractor's mental health.

When one of your Contractor's Limits, you must succeed a Trauma roll.

<p>
  When you create a Contractor, you receive 150 Experience (Exp) to spend defining their stats and background.
</p>
<p>
  Contractors can earn additional Exp in various ways after they're created, primarily by attending and claiming victory on Contracts.
</p>
<p>
  Exp earned on Contracts is spent in the same way as during Contractor creation. It represents a Contractor training a skill or conditioning themselves between Contracts.
</p>

<p>
  This page automatically calculates your remaining Exp as you fill out the character sheet.
