<p>
  Most Contractors draw upon some sort of otherworldly energy to activate their Powers, be it mana, rage, electricity,
  or something else.

<p>
  Here, you can flavor your Source by changing its name. You can also increase its maximum level by spending 2x current
  level Exp.
</p>
<p>
  Once you reach Novice status (3 victories), you can specify a condition under which you recover Source. This recovery has
  a cooldown of one day at Novice and one hour at Seasoned status (10+ victories).
