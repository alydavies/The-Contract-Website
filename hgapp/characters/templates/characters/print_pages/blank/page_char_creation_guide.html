            <h3>Step 1: Come up with a concept</h3>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text">
                Before you start filling out stats, you need a rough idea of who your Contractor is. <b>All Contractors
                have three things in common.</b>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center">You are Exceptional</h5>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text" v-html="tutorial['modal_1']">
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center">You Will Sign the Contract</h5>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text" v-html="tutorial['modal_2']">
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center">Incredible Powers Sleep Within You</h5>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text" v-html="tutorial['modal_3']">
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Fill in the Blanks</h3>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text">
                Fill in the blanks at the top of the first page.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contractor Name:</b> The name of your character.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Player Name:</b> Your own name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>#Victories, losses, and improvements:</b> These start at 0 and increase as you play.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Exp Remaining:</b> Leave this blank for now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Archetype:</b> Your Contractor's core concept, e.g. "Skater-punk Werewolf" or "Cannibal Celebrity Chef."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pronoun:</b> Your Contractor's preferred pronoun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Ambition:</b> What drives your Contractor to risk their lives for power? What do they want
                        to change about the status quo? Ambitions can change with time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Appearance:</b> How does your Contractor usually look?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Select Your Three Limits</h3>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text" >
                Limits describe experiences that test your ability to cope.
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text" >
                Most humans have the three default Limits: <b>Anguish,</b> <b>Atrocities,</b> and <b>Murder.</b>
                Other options are provided to enable different concepts, such as psychopaths, zealots, and faeries.
                <i>You can find the other available options and more details on the Limits sheet.</i>
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text" >
                Once you've selected your 3 Limits, write their names in the <b>Limits</b> field on the first page.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="css-double-col">
        <div class="padded-col css-how-to-character">
            <h3>Step 4: Buy Attributes and Abilities</h3>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                Attributes and Abilities define your Contractor's capabilities. The higher their values, the more likely
                you are to succeed at the Actions you attempt. <i>Read more details on the "Attributes and Abilities" sheet.</i>
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                You can increase Attributes and Abilities by spending Experience Points.
                <b>All new Contractors start with 150 Experience Points.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                The cost to increase an Attribute is its current rating x 5 (so buying the second level costs 5 Exp,
                and buying the third costs 10 more Exp for a total of 15 Exp). Abilities cost 2 Exp for the first level, and then 2x their
                current rating after that.
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                <b>If you'd rather not do the math,</b> you can select from the following Attribute/Ability value "spreads."
                These will use up all 150 starting Exp without you having to do any calculations.
            </p>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text">
                <b>Attribute Spreads.</b> Rank your contractor's Attributes from best to worst, then select a Spread to
                determine their values.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Leveraged:</b> 5, 3, 2, 2, 1
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Specialized:</b> 4, 4, 2, 2, 2
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Blind Spot:</b> 4, 3, 3, 3, 1
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Well-Rounded:</b> 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="css-tutorial-text">
                <b>Ability Spreads.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Devotee: </b> two Abilities at rank 5, two at 3, two at 2, one at 1
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Specialist: </b> one at 5, one at 4, three at 3, two at 2, three at 1
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Generalist:</b> six at 3, five at 2, three at 1
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5: Assets and Liabilities</h3>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                You can further customize your Contractor using Assets and Liabilities. These are only available at
                character creation, and allow you to start with various Conditions, Circumstances, Battle Scars, Traumas,
                and Loose Ends.
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                <b>If you are purchasing your stats with Exp,</b> each Asset costs 3 x its rating to buy, and each Liability
                credits 3 x its rating when you take it.
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                <b>If you are using "spreads"</b> take whichever Assets and Liabilities you'd like, but ensure they are
                balanced (the sum of your Assets' values is equal to the sum of your Liabilities' values).
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                <i>See the Assets and Liabilities sheets for a list of the available Assets and Liabilities.</i>
            </p>

            <h3>Step 6: Calculate your Stats</h3>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                Your Contractor's Body Rating represents their physical fortitude.
                <b>Body Rating = 5 + (Brawn / 2, rounded up).</b>
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                Your Contractor's Mind Rating represents thier mental / emotional fortitude.
                <b>Mind Rating = 1 + Charisma + Intellect, with a minimum rating of 3 and a maximum of 9.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="css-tutorial-text">
                Write your Mind and Body Ratings on the first page, and use a pen to complete the outlines
                of that many dotted boxes below, <b>Starting from the bottom.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
