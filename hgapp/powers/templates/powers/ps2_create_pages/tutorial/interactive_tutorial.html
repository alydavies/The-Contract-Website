                    The usefulness of a Gift depends on your opportunities to use it.

                            Sometimes a challenge is presented, and you have a tool for dealing with it.

                        <li>
                            In general, Contractors are tasked with controlling critical situations.

                                <li>
                                    They will need to understand the situation.

                                <li>
                                    They will need to exert control over the situation.

                                    They will need to survive the situation.

                        <li>
                            That said, which challenges are presented depends on the sorts of Scenarios your Playgroup tends to run.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If all you do is run fights, combat-based Gifts are going to be more relevant.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            More advanced Players learn to apply their Gifts in situations where their use isn't obvious.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some of the most powerful Gifts are only useful if you proactively plan how to use them.

                        <li>
                            For example, a Power to learn where someone sleeps would rarely resolve a Contract directly.
                            However, using that information, you may be able to set a trap for the target, learn more about them,
                            or kidnap their family to hold hostage.

                            Contractors don't have to deal with violence by killing things, but if they don't have

                    At the same time, politics more relevant for Veterans than anyone. A Contractor who will risk their

                    Downtimes are the main event for Veterans. Work with your Playgroups GMs to start shaping the setting

                    The Gift Builder is a creative tool. There is often more than one way to build a given concept.

                    Sometimes a concept that seems singular is best represented by several Gifts.

                        <li>
                            For example, let's say you want to create a Power that gives your Contractor control over plants.

                        <li>
                            A Restrict Effect will allow you to summon grasping roots and vines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An Advanced Movement Effect will allow you to pass through dense underbrush unhindered.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An Injure Effect will allow you to injure your enemies with razor-sharp leaves.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An Animate effect will let you bring trees to life to clobber your enemies.
                        </li>

        Designing the Gift Builder
    </h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
            <h4>Why is such an elaborate Gift Builder necessary?</h4>
            <p>
                The goal of any designer is to create an elegant solution to a problem.
                While we hope the Gift Builder is dead-simple for Players to use, its design and construction is
                necessarily complex to achieve our design goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, The Contract's goals necessitate a Gift system that simultaneously
                <b>enables highly-custom character concepts</b> while <b>utilizing mechanically-specific systems</b>.
            </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Enable highly-custom character concepts.</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Contractors must feel unique, and the Player must engage creatively in the
                                    construction of their Contractor's kit and concept.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    This invests Players in their characters, which is critical to telling a compelling
                                    story.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Utilize mechanically-specific systems.</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Vague, "squishy" systems work for some games, but The Contract requires a specific
                                    "crunchy" system to achieve its goals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>The Contract is a challenging game that feels fair.</b>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            A game is challenging if failure is defined, possible, and preventable with skill.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Failure that feels arbitrary or "unfair" is frustrating, at best.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            "Crunchy" systems create a social contract of fair play between the GM and
                                            Player that makes the game's outcome feel less arbitrary.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Your Contractor plays the same no matter who is GM.</b>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            As part of The Contract's goal to address the organizational and scheduling
                                            challenges common in TTRPGs, Contractors must be playable no matter who is
                                            acting as GM that day.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Specific systems minimize differences between how a Contractor's Gifts
                                            behave under various GMs, which is critical because their lives are on the
                                            line.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Essentially, this means strategic gameplay is steered away from creative
                                            interpretation of resources ("what is 'a hammer' anyway?") towards creative
                                            utilization of resources ("how can I use this hammer to solve the problem?")
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            <p>
                Only this Gift Builder empowers Players to create crunchy systems for any concept, and it does so
                in a way that aligns with the other gameplay goals of The Contract. The necessary complexity of this
                system is the reason why The Contract is published as a website instead of a book.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Note: the Gift Builder is only used between game sessions, and it is the only aspect of
                        The Contract's gameplay that requires using the website. At game-time, The Contract can play
                        like a normal TTRPG.

            <h4>
                The Gift Builder's Systems
            </h4>
            The Gift Builder is opinionated about the sorts of systems it creates.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Gifts break Contractors free of gritty realism.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Contractors are not superheroes. Newbie Contractors get mugged, arrested, and kidnapped.
                            They get in trouble for running their mouths. They lose track of their gear. They wear the wrong shoes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gifts are the only thing that elevates Contractors above the mundane, and that makes them feel
                            very special.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keeping the mundane, banal obstacles in-tact creates opportunities for strategy.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If your western gunslinger is invited to a Contract
                                    in the UK and doesn't have a way to bring their guns, well they're going to look pretty stupid
                                    until they somehow obtain a gun.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The focus is on creative problem-solving, not min-maxing numbers.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We use numerical systems in The Contract, but obtaining bigger numbers is not the focus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dice modifiers are used sparingly. Instead, we think of balance in terms of
                            capability and reliability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Gift Builder tries to enforce that Drawbacks are never "free" and always have a real impact
                            on a Gift's usefulness.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Minimize Dice rolls. Keep the action moving.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Each play session of The Contract is a self-contained mission. Action needs to keep
                            moving so that the game can resolve in a timely manner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rolling dice is fun and great, but only when it matters. When dice rolls become
                            tedious or pointless, they bog the game and story down.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extensive playtesting during our open Alpha release has allowed us to streamline
                            many  systems in subtle ways that are not be immediately obvious.
                            For example, we do not have "action economy bloat" that leads to one Player's turn in combat lasting
                            an extremely long time.
                        </li>

                </li>

                    <b>Encourage interesting action and situations.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Using a Gift, whether it succeeds or fails, should always lead to a more interesting situation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many of the Gift Builder's systems either create interesting situations or encourage Players
                            to apply interesting strategies in order to get the most from their Gifts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Balance and Advancement for The Contract's format.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A Gift's cost reflects its maximum potential usefulness on Contracts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The ability to cure cancer costs one Gift. Effective, reliable telekinesis costs many Gifts.
                            This is because curing cancer is rarely relevant on Contracts but TK is often useful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Status requirements restrict classes of capabilities to Contractors with a certain number of
                            Victories. This provides Scenario-writers with guidelines on which sorts of challenges
                            Contractors of a particular status might be able to side-step.
