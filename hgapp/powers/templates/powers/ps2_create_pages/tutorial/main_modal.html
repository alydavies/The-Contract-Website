<p>
        Each session of The Contract, the Players' Contractors are invited to risk their lives in a deadly mission.
    <b>
        Those who succeed are rewarded with a Gift Credit that can be spent here in exchange for extraordinary Artifacts or incredible Powers.
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    No two Contractors are alike. Each Contractor's Gifts are a unique expression of their concept, and any character
    concept can be realized by building custom Gifts.
</p>
<p>
    Each Gift's system is automatically generated during creation. These systems are simple but very specific.
    While wordy, such specific systems focus gameplay on <i>using</i> Gifts creatively rather than
    <i>interpreting</i> them creatively, and they ensure your Contractor plays the same no matter who is acting as GM.

        Form an idea of what you want your Contractor to be able to do.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe your concept to this Gift-Building webpage. Select a Gift Type and Effect, then customize its modifiers
        until it matches your idea.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply flavor to your Gift by adding a description, name, and tagline.
