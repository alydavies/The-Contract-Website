<p>
    One of the best parts about The Contract is building Gifts that are custom-made to fit your Contractor. However, creating Gifts with the Gift Builder is its own skill.
</p>
<p>
    To make things easier, you can use these Stock Gifts as starting points.
</p>
<p>
    These Gifts cover common archetypes and powers. Although they are arranged by theme, there are no classes in The
    Contract. Any Contractor may select Gifts from any category, and Players are encouraged to customize the Gifts to
    match their Contractor’s concept.
</p>
<p>
    All of these Stock Gifts can be taken with a single Gift Credit and improved using future Gift Credits and
    Improvements. Many powerful enhancements can be purchased via the “customize” page.
</p>
<p>
    Each Gift's system was automatically generated by the Gift Builder. These systems are simple but very specific.
    While sometimes wordy, specific systems focus gameplay on <i>using</i> Gifts creatively rather than
    <i>interpreting</i> them creatively, and they ensure your Contractor plays the same no matter who is acting as GM.
