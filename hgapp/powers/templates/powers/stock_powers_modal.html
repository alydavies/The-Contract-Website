<p>
    In The Contract, each Contractor's Gifts are custom-made to fit their concept.
    However, using the Gift Builder to create Gifts from scratch can be daunting for newbies and is a skill in its own right.
</p>
<p>
    To make things easier, you can use these Stock Gifts as starting points.
</p>
<p>
    These {{total_gift_count}} Stock Gifts cover many popular power and item
    concepts. Although they are arranged by character theme, there are no classes in The Contract. Any Contractor may
    select Gifts from any category, and Players are encouraged to customize their Gifts to match their Contractor’s concept.
</p>
<p>
    Contractors receive a Gift Credit when they claim victory on a Contract. All Stock Gifts can be purchased with a
    single Gift Credit and improved in the future with additional Gift Credits or Improvements. Many powerful
    enhancements can be purchased via the “customize” page for each Gift, so don't mistake these starting-points as the
    end-all of Contractor advancement.
</p>
<p>
    All of these Stock Gifts were created with the Gift Builder, and each one's system text was automatically generated.
    Their systems are simple but specific. While such precise systems can be verbose, they focus gameplay on <i>using</i> Gifts
    creatively rather than <i>interpreting</i> them, and they ensure your Contractor plays the same no matter
    who is acting as GM.
