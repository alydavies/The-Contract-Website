            <b>Between Contracts</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The time between Contracts is called Downtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contractors can't earn Gifts or Experience by doing things on their Downtimes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most Newbie and low-Novice Contractors spend their Downtimes doing little other than healing, training (spending Experience Points), and preparing for future Contracts.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            No roleplay or GM oversight is necessary for any of these activities.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    More advanced Contractors take initiative during their Downtimes to seek other forms of power and change the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For more seasoned Contractors, Downtimes can become as important as the Contracts themselves.

            <b>Moves</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When Contractors take initiative on a Downtime to gain some benefit, it's called making a <b>Move</b>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            They may seek out powerful artifacts, form a cult, make a fortune, or try to change the world.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unlike with Contracts, if a Player wants to make a Move, they must determine their own goal and plan to achieve it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moves require a GM. Depending on their nature, they may be concluded with a couple of rolls or be more involved and dangerous than a Contract.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Loose Ends</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Not all Contracts go smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Loose Ends</b> represent enemies, legal troubles, and other latent threats acquired on Contracts and Moves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time a Contractor attends a Contract, their Loose Ends grow closer to biting them.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If a Contractor doesn't make a Move to resolve a Loose End before it expires, they suffer serious consequences.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            The narrative in this guide takes place in the default setting of The Contract: <b>Illuminated Earth.</b>
        </div>
        <div class="css-narrative">
            <p>
                Illuminated Earth is a version of the modern world where the advent of smartphones and the internet confirmed the existence of the supernatural instead of disproving it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Distributed video hosting services like CryptoLeak ensure no videos of the supernatural are censored by
                government or conspiracy. However, they are filled with hoaxes and misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the relative rarity of the unexplainable, the specter of magic and otherworldly phenomena looms large in the zeitgeist.
                As a result, modern society has twisted into a superstitious and paranoid reflection of itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, some witch hunts <i>do</i> have merit. It's an open secret that billionaires and Senators employ paranormal advisors and bodyguards. Charlatans become pop culture icons, and each revelation inspires a new cult.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world is changing. The secret societies that pull humanity's strings are scrambling to adapt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now's a good time to move up.

        <li>The true story of The Contract is in the format: powerful beings approach ambitious individuals and offer them a deal to go on deadly missions in exchange for powers.</li>

        <li>
            It’s easy to picture such a story taking place in any number of settings.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some groups prefer to use established settings from TV, movies, books, anime, or other roleplaying games.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Magical or mundane, modern settings work best for The Contract.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Although Contractors' stats and Gifts are tightly balanced, elements of the setting and the Contracts themselves
            are not subject to any balance requirements.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Playgroups can introduce any supernatural elements into their settings that they want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Players do not have out-of-character knowledge about the systems of the creatures and situations they are facing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    GMs and Scenario-writers have an idea what sorts of capabilities Contractors of a given Status may bring to the table.

                        <li>Your Contractor is transported to that Playgroup's setting for the duration of the Contract and returned to their home setting immediately afterwards.</li>
                        <li>While traveling between settings, only your Contractor’s Attributes, Abilities, and Gifts are guaranteed to work. </li>

                            Equipment may not travel with you, and supernatural items and conditions that were obtained in one Playgroup's setting (outside of Gifts) may work differently or not at all in another.
